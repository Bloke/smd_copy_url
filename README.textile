h1. smd_copy_url

Adds a small 'copy' link alongside the url_title on the Write panel, and alongside each title on the Articles list panel. Click that to copy the current article URL to the clipboard (without domain), which you can use in Textile links and anchors to refer to the current article.

Although it seems superfluous on the Articles panel because you can just copy the value in the Status column, this plugin has one advantage: the URL is valid regardless of the article status. Draft, Hidden, and Pending articles all return the final URL that will be used when/if the article is published. Handy for creating links to articles that aren't yet published.

Notes:

* The plugin takes into account all permlink schemes _except_ @/breadcrumb/title@ (at the moment: ideas welcome on how to sanely handle it).
* If you are creating a new article, you cannot use the copy URL link if you are using any permlink scheme that requires an ID (messy, /section/id/title, or /id/title). You must save the article first so it is assigned an ID.
* There's currently no feedback to know that you've copied the link (besides a notification in the JavaScript console). Anybody who has ideas on how best to indicate the action has succeeded, please speak up.
